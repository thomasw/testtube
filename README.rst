Installation
------------

Install testtube like you'd install any other python package:

::

    pip install testtube

testtube is tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.4 and pypy.

Usage
-----

1. Configure testtube
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to configure testtube is to drop a tube.py file in
whatever directory you'll be running the testtube watch command
(``stir``) from. The only thing that needs to be in that file is an
iterable of tuples named ``PATTERNS`` consisting of a regular expression
and a list of tests to run.

Here's an example ``tube.py`` file from the testtube repo:

.. code:: python

    from testtube.helpers import Frosted, Nosetests, Pep257, Flake8

    PATTERNS = (
        # Run pep257 check against a file if it changes, excluding files that have
        # test_ or tube.py in the name.
        # If this test fails, don't make any noise (0 bells on failure)
        (
            r'((?!test_)(?!tube\.py).)*\.py$',
            [Pep257(bells=0)]
        ),
        # Run flake8 and Frosted on the entire project when a python file changes.
        # If these checks fail, abort the entire test suite because failure might
        # be due to a syntax error. There's no point running the subsequent tests
        # if there is such an error.
        (
            r'.*\.py$',
            [Flake8(all_files=True), Frosted(all_files=True)],
            {'fail_fast': True}
        ),
        # Run the test suite whenever python or test config files change.
        (
            r'(.*setup\.cfg$)|(.*\.coveragerc)|(.*\.py$)',
            [Nosetests()]
        )
    )

In the example above, there are a series of patterns, coupled with a
list of callable tests generated via builtin helpers and, in one case,
an optional test group configuration.

A test, at its simplest, is just a method that returns ``True`` or
``False`` after being passed the path to a changed file and a regular
expression match object for the path's match against the test group's
regular expression. The example uses several helpers that ship with
testtube. These helpers are callable objects that can be configured in
various ways when they are instantiated.

Testtube comes with a number of these helpers, which you can find in
`helpers.py <https://github.com/thomasw/testtube/blob/master/testtube/helpers.py>`_.
They are designed to save you from writing your own tests as much as
possible. If they don't meet your needs, see `Writing your own
tests <#writing-your-own-tests>`_.

Included helpers:

-  Pep8
-  Pyflakes
-  Frosted
-  Pep257
-  Nosetests
-  PythonSetupPyTest (runs python setup.py when matching files change)
-  ClearScreen

Helpers typically accept the following arguments when instantiated:

-  ``all_files``: run the test against the entire source directory
   instead of just the changed file (which is the default behavior)
-  ``fail_fast``: Abort running the rest of the test group if the test
   fails.
-  ``bells``: On failure, testtube will audibly notify you 3 times
   unless otherwise specified
-  ``name``: The name of the test in test report output

The following generates a pep8 test configured to run against all files,
abort processing of its test group on failure, alert the user 5 times
audibly, and show up as "follow pep8 dude" in test report output:

.. code:: python

    from testtube.helpers import Pep8

    helper = Pep8(
        all_files=True, fail_fast=True, bells=5, name='follow pep8 dude')

Note that helpers, once instantiated, are just callables that return
``True`` or ``False``:

.. code:: python

    # Once configured, helpers are callables (they act like methods) that
    # accept a path to a python file and a regex match object (though the
    # match object isn't a requirement).

    helper('/path/to/some/file.py', None)

And here's that same example fully incorporated into a tube.py file:

.. code:: python

    from testtube.helpers import Pep8


    PATTERNS = [
        [
            # Pattern
            r'.*\.py$',
            # list of callable tests to run
            [
                Pep8(
                    all_files=True, fail_fast=True, bells=5,
                    name='follow pep8 dude')
            ]
        ]
    ]

The behavior of helpers can be customized as necessary by overriding
specific methods. See
`helpers.py <https://github.com/thomasw/testtube/blob/master/testtube/helpers.py>`_
for further information.

In addition to configuring helpers, test groups can also be configured:

-  ``fail_fast``: abort processing of subsequent test groups if all
   tests in the configured group did not pass.

In the first example tube.py file, the second test group is configured
to abort the rest of the test suite if either ``Flake8`` or ``Frosted``
fail.

2. Stir it
~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have a tube.py file, tell testtube to watch your project for
changes:

::

    $ stir
    testtube is now watching /Path/to/CWD/ for changes...

By default, stir will watch your current working directory and configure
itself with a settings module named ``tube`` (tube.py). If you dropped a
tube.py file into your project root, then you shouldn't need to specify
any parameters assuming you execute stir from that directory. If you've
customized things a bit, ``stir -h`` will light the way:

::

    $ stir -h
    usage: stir [-h] [--src_dir SRC_DIR] [--settings SETTINGS]

    Watch a directory and run a custom set of tests whenever a file changes.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit
      --src_dir SRC_DIR    The directory to watch for changes. (Defaults to CWD)
      --settings SETTINGS  Path to a testtube settings file that defines which
                           tests to run (Defaults to "tube.py" - your settings
                           file must be importable and the path must be relative
                           to your CWD)

Writing your own tests
----------------------

If the included helpers don't do what you need, you can write your own
tests right in your settings module. Simply define a callable that
accepts two arguments and add it to your patterns list:

.. code:: python

    def mytest(changed_file, match_obj):
        print "Oh snap, %s just changed" % changed_file

    PATTERNS = (
        (r'.*', [mytest]),
    )

If you'd like to write tests that are configurable like the builtin
helpers, you can simply extend the base helper class. Here's a tube.py
file that outputs the file tree for the entire project each time a
python file changes:

.. code:: python

    from testtube.helpers import Helper


    class ProjectTree(Helper):
        command = 'tree'
        all_files = True

        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super(ProjectTree, self).__init__()

            # TreeOutput only works on all files, so override any contrary config
            self.all_files = True

    PATTERNS = (
        (r'.*\.py$', [ProjectTree(all_files=True)]),
    )

Note that this example requires tree to be installed on your system
(``$ brew install tree`` for OS X users).

Caveats
-------

-  Note the difference between ``r'.*\.py'`` and ``r'.*\.py$'``. If you
   leave off that ``$``, then testtube will run your tests everytime pyc
   files change.
-  testtube doesn't currently reload its own configuration when it
   changes. If you reconfigure things, you'll need to kill testtube and
   restart it for those changes to take effect.
